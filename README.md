# SURVEY APP

This is a Node.js application that allows users to create surveys, including yes/no and scale questions,
send the survey to participants, and collect their answers. You can visit in the site: https://survey-services.netlify.app/

## TECHNOLOGIES

The Create Surveys App is built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB as the database for storing surveys
and responses, and incorporates technologies such as React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface and client-side interactivity.
It also incorporates MailJS library for sending survey invitations via email to participants.

## RUNNING APP LOCALLY

To run the Node.js app locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running the following command in the project directory: 
   
    #### npm install
   
2. Start the application using either nodemon (for automatic restart on file changes during development) or node: 
   
    #### nodemon index.js 
    
    #### node index.js


Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your local machine before running the above commands.
